# 🎵 Spotify Songs' Genre Segmentation This project performs unsupervised clustering and analysis of Spotify songs based on their audio features to group them into genres and recommend similar songs. It uses a dataset containing various Spotify audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, tempo, and more. ## 🚀 Objective The goal is to: - Preprocess and explore a Spotify dataset - Visualize audio feature distributions and interrelationships - Perform clustering using K-Means - Visualize clusters using PCA - Build a basic recommendation system using cosine similarity ## 📊 Dataset - Format: CSV - Columns: `track_name`, `artist_name`, `playlist_genre`, `playlist_subgenre`, and several audio features including: - `danceability` - `energy` - `loudness` - `speechiness` - `acousticness` - `instrumentalness` - `liveness` - `valence` - `tempo` - `duration_ms` Place your dataset file as: 

spotify_dataset.csv

## 🧪 Technologies Used - Python - pandas, numpy - matplotlib, seaborn - scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler, PCA) - cosine_similarity (for recommendations) ## 📌 Features ✔️ Data preprocessing (missing values, normalization) ✔️ Visualizations (distribution, heatmaps, countplots) ✔️ Correlation matrix ✔️ K-Means clustering using Elbow Method ✔️ PCA for 2D cluster visualization ✔️ Genre-based song recommendation engine ## 📈 Visualizations - Genre and subgenre distribution (bar charts) - Audio feature histograms - Correlation matrix heatmap - K-Means Elbow curve - PCA cluster plot ## 🔍 Clustering & Modeling - KMeans used for unsupervised clustering - Optimal number of clusters found using the Elbow Method - PCA used to reduce features to 2D for visualization ## 🎧 Recommendation System A basic recommendation function finds similar songs using cosine similarity: ```python def recommend_song(song_name, n_recommendations=5): # Returns top N similar songs based on audio features
